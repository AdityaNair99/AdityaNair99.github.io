# Projects

## **Final Project for CS 285 (Deep Reinforcement Learning)**
- Written during my final year at Berkeley with another student,
[this paper]({% link 285FinalProject.html %}) was entitled
*Multi-Agent RL for Unidentified Adversaries and Collaborators*, and combines
Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient with Bayesian Inference to
determine adversarial behavior in a multi agent environment where the adversary
is unknown.

## **West Coast Datathon Fall 2020**
- Written during a Citadel Datathon as part of a team of 4, we attempted to both predict
 the likelihood of a collaboration between an actor and a director, and construct
 a hierarchy from the given data. We produced a datafolio viewable
 [here](https://github.com/AdityaNair99/West-Coast-Datathon-F2020/blob/master/datafolio/Team_3_Datafolio.pdf)
and a paper [here](https://github.com/AdityaNair99/West-Coast-Datathon-F2020/blob/master/manuscript/Team_3_report.pdf)
